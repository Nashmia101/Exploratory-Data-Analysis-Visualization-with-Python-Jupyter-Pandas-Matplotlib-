Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization with Python
Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python as a data science tool to investigate, process, and visualize data. The analysis focuses on reading and extracting information from datasets, applying exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, and communicating findings through structured reporting.

Objectives

Data Extraction: Read and process structured data files in Python.

Exploratory Analysis: Apply both graphical (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and non-graphical tools to identify patterns and trends.

Data Management: Use pandas and NumPy for cleaning, filtering, and transformation.

Visualization & Reporting: Present insights using visualizations and document findings clearly.

Tools & Techniques

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas, NumPy – Data processing and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
